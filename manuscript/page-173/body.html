<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Madame, I wish your rosebush to flower all year long; I am infinitely obliged to you for taking part in the honors bestowed upon me; and I am very happy to see you returned here, so I can make very humble excuses for the ridiculous behavior of my wife.</p><p>DORIMÈNE: That's nothing. I excuse her jumping to conclusions: your heart must be precious to her, and it isn't strange that the possession of such a man as you should inspire some jealousy.</p><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: The possession of my heart is a thing that has been entirely gained by you.</p><p>DORANTE: You see, Madame, that Monsieur Jourdain is not one of those men that good fortune blinds, and that he still knows, even in his glory, how to recognize his friends.</p><p>DORIMÈNE: It is the mark of a completely generous soul.</p></div> </div>
