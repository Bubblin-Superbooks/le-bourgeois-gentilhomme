<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">hour, Madame, we've been signaling to you. Don't you see that all this is done only to accommodate ourselves to the fantasies of your husband, that we are fooling him under this disguise and that it is Cl√©onte himself who is the son of the Grand Turk?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Ah! Ah!</p><p>COVIELLE: And I, Covielle, am the interpreter?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Ah! If this is the case then, I surrender.</p><p>COVIELLE: Don't let on.</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, it's done, I agree to the marriage.</p><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Ah! Now everyone's reasonable. You didn't want to hear it. I knew he would explain to you what it means to be the son of the Grand Turk.</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: He explained it to me very well, and I am satisfied. Let us send for a notary.</p></div> </div>
