For my part, I am scandalized at the life you lead. I no longer recognize our house. One would say it's the beginning of Carnival here, every day; and beginning early in the morning, so it won't be forgotten, one hears nothing but the racket of fiddles and singers which disturbs the whole neighborhood.</p><p>NICOLE: Madame speaks well. I'll never be able to get my housework done properly with that gang you have come here. They have feet that hunt for mud in every part of town to bring it here; and poor Fran√ßoise almost has her teeth on the floor, scrubbing the boards that your fine masters come to dirty up every day.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: What, our servant</p></div> </div>
