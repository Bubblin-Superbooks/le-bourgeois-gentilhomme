You both talk like beasts, and I'm ashamed of your ignorance. For example, do you know what are you speaking just now?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Yes, I know that what I'm saying is well said and that you ought to be considering living in another way.</p><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm not talking about that. I'm asking if you know what the words are that you are saying here?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: They are words that are very sensible, and your conduct is scarcely so.</p><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: I'm not talking about that, I tell you. I'm asking you: what is it that I'm speaking to you this minute, what is it?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Nonsense.</p></div> </div>
