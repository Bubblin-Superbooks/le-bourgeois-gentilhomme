Is it not a thing which does me great honor, that a person of this quality is seen to come so often to my house, who calls me his dear friend and treats me as if I were his equal?

Isn't it an honor for me to lend money to a man of that condition? And can I do less for a lord who calls me his dear friend?</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: And this lord, what does he do for you?</p><p>MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Things that would astonish you if you knew them.</p><p>MADAME JOURDAIN: Like what?</p></div> </div>
